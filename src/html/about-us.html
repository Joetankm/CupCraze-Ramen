                Our journey began in 2020, during the early days of the pandemic when travel restrictions were in place, and many of my friends and I found ourselves unable to explore new places. During this challenging time, we longed for the taste of global cuisines, which sparked the idea for our business. We wanted to share the joy of discovering new flavors and cultures through ramen, even when travel was not an option.
                
                Starting CupCraze Ramen was not just about satisfying our cravings; it was about creating a community where others could experience the excitement of global travel through food. Our noodles cook quickly and are packed with delicious, authentic flavors, making them the perfect meal for those seeking quality and convenience.
